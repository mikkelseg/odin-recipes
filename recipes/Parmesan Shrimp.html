      <h2>What you need to know about Garlic Parmesan Shrimp</h2>
      <p>Delicious crispy shrimp coated in a bread crumb-Parmesan mixture.</p>
      <p>My family can't get enough of it! I would suggest doubling the recipe if you have very large eaters because this is addictive! Serve with pasta and salad.</p>
